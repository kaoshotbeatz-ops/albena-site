> Albena is a private, local-first AI assistant for your home and life, made by Omar Huertas LLC. Early access; not yet generally available. Canonical site: https://albena.ai. Short index: https://albena.ai/llms.txt

## What Albena is

Albena is a voice-first AI assistant ("Hey Albena") that runs on hardware you own: a Mac with Apple silicon, or an NVIDIA RTX Linux machine. Everyday requests are handled by local models (and Apple on-device intelligence on a Mac). A cloud model is used only if a task needs it and you allow it, and Albena tells you when she reaches for one. Every change is proposed to the owner first; high-risk changes also need a change record and a PIN, and are recorded in an audit log with rollback information. Memory of people, routines and preferences is stored on the owner's hardware first and can be viewed, corrected and deleted.

## Editions (early access, pricing not announced)

- Albena Hub for Mac: Apple silicon Mac mini with Albena preinstalled. Low power, near silent, suited to a household. ${abs('/hardware')}
- Albena Hub for NVIDIA: RTX GPU workstation or server-class machine for larger local models, camera and vision AI, multi-user households, estates and small businesses. ${abs('/hardware')}
- Bring Your Own: software license to install Albena on a Mac (Apple silicon) or NVIDIA Linux machine you already own.
